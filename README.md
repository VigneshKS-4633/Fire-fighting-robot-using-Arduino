# Fire-fighting-robot-using-Arduino
This project creates an autonomous fire-fighting robot using Arduino Uno and flame sensors. It detects fire, moves toward it, and extinguishes it using a relay-controlled system. Designed for hazardous or hard-to-reach areas, it offers a low-cost, IoT-enabled fire safety solution using embedded systems.
